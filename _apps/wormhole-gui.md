Wormhole-gui is a graphical interface for magic-wormhole. It uses the Go implementation [wormhole-william](https://github.com/psanford/wormhole-william) along with [fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne) for the graphical interface. The initial version was built in less than one day to show how quick and easy it is to use fyne for developing applications.
