The user wants to develop a graphical desktop application using the Fyne toolkit in Go (Golang), which can be used to manage and interact with a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster.
This implies building a GUI-based Kubernetes management tool â€” similar to kubectl, but with a visual interface, allowing users to view resources (like Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.), describe them, apply YAML manifests, and perform actions like delete, scale, or restart workloads.
