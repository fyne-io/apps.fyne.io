Conway's Game of Life is sometimes described as a zero player game. You set up a collection of living cells on an effectively infinite grid, and then they evolve based on a couple of simple rules. A cell that is currently alive will survive if it has 2 or 3 living neighbors (less it dies of loneliness, more it dies of overcrowding), and a dead cell that has exactly 3 living neighbors is "born". This yields surprisingly complex behaviors, and even be used to comstruct a simple computer (though not a very fast one.)
