An easy to use public key encryption program for your YubiKey.

Supported YubiKey algorithms:

For encryption with slot 9d:

RSA: 2048, 3072, 4096 bits

For signing with slot 9c:

ECC: P-256, P-384, Ed25519

Simply use Yubico Authenticator to create your signing and
encryption certificate and export your encryption certificate,
to give it to your friends. You don&#39;t have to export your signing
certificate, because it is not needed for signature verification.
